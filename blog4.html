                        <img src="images/mt buller frens landscape.jpg">
                        It all started with a casual "hey guys, wouldn't it be cool if we go snow-skiing next week" while we were queueing for bumper cars. The ensuing confusion and then laughter and then straight faces when they realised I was serious was the precursor to our great adventure :D
                        <br><br>
                        Only a heat-hater such as myself would be desperate to search for snow in the middle of august, but Australia presented me such an opportunity as this :^) 
                        <br><br>
                        So after much persuasion, we clicked buy on the Mt Buller day trip ski package on Klook and got to packing!
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>0515AM: Departure</strong>
                        <img src="images/Mt Buller/wait_bus.jpg">
                        This tour starts really really early, reporting time for the bus was 545AM and there wasn't any waiting for latecomers ðŸ˜¶
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>0600AM: All aboard the bus!</strong>

                        This is us getting all tucked in, ready to nap for the next 2 hours at least (I did not nap) (I stared out the window taking photos of grass and cows every 15 minutes) 
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="images/Mt Buller/hotairballon.jpg">
                        saw some fellas taking the hot air balloon while on our journey there (flying at 7am is crazyyy but they must've caught a nice sunrise)

                        everywhere in aussie just looks like that Windows XP default background (But in real life!)
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>0730AM: Pit stop at Yea</strong><br><br>
                        Just a toilet break but I can't believe this town is called Yea, I had to include it in.

                        <br><br>
                        <strong>0850AM: First sightings of snow!</strong>
                        <img src="images/Mt Buller/first_snow.jpg">

                        <strong>0900AM - 1200PM: Equipment and ski class</strong><br><br>
                        The process of getting into skates and acquiring all the equipment is actually soooo long and tedious. And once you get your ski skates on, walking becomes 100x more uncomfortable. Definitely wasn't a fan at the start, tho it does get more bearable once you get used to it. By the time we all rented our equipment and got to the cablecar a whole hour had already passed. Which stressed me out because we had to leave this place at 4pm zzz. But ah wellz such are the gives and takes of going with tour groups.
                        <img src="images/Mt Buller/gear.jpg">

                        Check out this insane view from the cablecar ride we had to take to get to the beginner ski area. It was altogether stupendous and daunting at the same time (since there's no other way to get across besides hopping onto this thing and it doesn't slow down for you to get on you just gotta place your butt on in time shdjkfhksdhf)

                        <img src="images/Mt Buller/cable_car_down.jpg">

                        
                        Now for the actual ski lesson itself we were given a pretty terrible teacher if I've seen one. He was unfocused, didn't bother to wait for us to catch up, and lowkey kinda racist... crazy cuz he looked at least half asian or full asian too ??? but anyways tldr we kinda ditched him after awhile and learned on our own. 
                        <img src="images/Mt Buller/ski_sun.jpg">
                        (the main ski area was a tiny hill! We didn't get to do those big hills out of fear that we'd trip/ram into a tree)
                        Didn't let this bad apple ruin the rest of our experience, learning to ski for the first time was still crazy fun! And unseemingly tiring as well HAHA we were sweating in all our skii jackets, at some point we just took them off. Strangely enough, I think it's colder in the city than it is up on the mountain, I wasn't cold at all. It was more of a nice warmth amid chilly but still temperatures.

                        <img src="images/Mt Buller/skii_give_up.jpg">
                        (this is me tired and abot ready to chuck off the equipment and go explore the rest of the area instead)

                        <br><br>
                        Halfway through skiing we went to get some grub at the cafe! The food was reasonably priced and the cafe had great views and was a cozy respite from the chaos of learning to skii for the first time.
                        <img src="images/Mt Buller/cafe.jpg">

                        <br><br>
                        <strong>1200PM - 1500PM: The world is your mountain!</strong><br><br>

                        After lunch we all went back to try going down the beginner hill a couple more times, I crashed a couple of times but when I finally got to the bottom without crashing I was so happy I forgot I still need to somehow stop myself from crashing into the people at the bottom of the hill so I reluctantly without knowing what else to do, threw myself to the side to self-crash  &#x1F921;
                        <br><br>
                        But yay I was so happy to succeed, I felt like I was finally getting the hang of it. Honestly, I would love to have another week or so to just master skiing and then try going down the big kids hill :(
                        but alas, time did not afford us such an option.
                        <br><br>
                        But yea I soon realised we running out of play time on the mountain so I opted to go snowball making and sight-drinking (drinking in those delicious milkshake skies) instead.
                        Oh and snowball making I did. Not just any snowball tho, only the most ROUND COMPLETE PERFECT SNOWBALL KNOWN TO MAN
                        <img src="images/Mt Buller/round_ball.jpg">

                        we also made a buncha snow angels on the ground XD 
                        <img src="images/Mt Buller/snow_angel.jpg">

                        I found my favourite viewing area at a corner of the mountain away from the crowd. The sights from Mt Buller will defintely be one of my favourite for a long while.
                        <img src="images/mount buller clear sky.jpg">
                        I took a good deep breath and exhaled out what felt like years worth of stress. Something about the mountains are always just healing to my soul. Decided to take more of a chill pill by laying flat on the ground (haha chill pill get it cuz its cold)(ha)
                        <img src="images/Mt Buller/lay_in_snow.jpg">

                        That was about as much as the time we had allowed us to do so by the time it hit three we took the cable car back and returned all our equipment then hopped back onto the bus to go back to the city.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>1700PM-2000PM: Way back home</strong><br><br>
                        On our way back we stopped by Yea again but at this time (around 6:40pm) a nice purple-orange ombre had ascended upon the town. Credits to Jia Min for taking this vibey photo.

                        <strong>2030PM: Makan jer</strong>

                        <img src="images/Mt Buller/hot_pot_dinner.jpg">
                        Once we reached the city it was hotpot time &#x1F60B;
                        <br><br>
                        And then it wassa wrap! Mt buller trip definitely was a little rushed but all in all I'm so happy I got to finally learn snow-skiing and I MUST RETURNNN to get better and also learn snowboarding one day! The world is just full of adventures I've yet to see.
