                        What started off as an unassuming last-minute day trip we booked on KKDay turned out to be one of the best tours me and the gang have gone on this entire exchange. In Hasif's very passionate telling "the best tour in MY LIFE OKAY". It's definitely up there for me too, highly due to the our AMAZING tour guide Mr Chris!!! Extremely passionate and cute old man who loves his job, which I'll elaborate more about. O'right, let's run it from the top!
                        <br><br>
                        <em>Stop #1: 1030AM Brunch at Darling Harbour</em>
                        <img src="images/bluemountainbrunch.jpg">
                    
                        Our meetup point for the tour was 12pm at Darling Harbour in Sydney (oh yes, this tour takes place in sydney btw LOL) so we decided to brunch at a cafe nearby called Wild Sage.
                        <img src="images/bluemountainbrunch2.jpg">
                        After lunch we headed off to the bus where we met our tour guide and driver Chris, who gave us many fun facts about the mountains and the animals at the zoo we were gonna visit on the way to the mountains (ticket included in the tour!)
                        <br><br>
                        <em>Stop #2 : 1300PM Featherdale Zoo</em>
                        
                        
                        <img src="images/featherdalezooentrance.jpg" id="crop2">
                        First on the itinerary is featherdale zoo! Rather small compared to the main Sydney Taronga zoo but it had a lot of different animal sections and had feeding areas for you to play with wallabies and kangaroos, so of course we had to buy some feed muahaha
                        <img src="images/featherdalefeeed.jpg" id="crop2">
                        We got to snappin and pattin and have you truly visited australia if you haven't held one of their many furry brown creatures (that all be kinda similar to each other)?
                        <img src="images/mewallaby.jpg" id="crop2">
                        Me and Cheyne also paid to take the official koala photo like the easy tourists we are
                        <img src="images/me cheyne koala.jpg">
                        But seriously, I saw so many interesting animals up close, even the koalas were posing for us
                        <img src="images/tasmaniandevil.jpg">
                        <img src="images/posing_koalas.jpg">

                        My only regret was that I MISSED THE QUOKKA EXHIBIT TT which apparently was hidden somewhere in the zoo but I couldn't rush back to see because we had to drive off to the next location. But it's okay I'm sure I'll see more quokkas before I leave aussie (plsplspls)
                        <br><br>
                        <em>Stop #3 : 1500PM Blue Mountain - Lincoln's Rock</em>
                        <img src="images/blue montain pose.jpg">
                        <img src="images/blue mountain rocks.jpg">
                        

                        The first stop once we reached the Blue Mountains was Lincoln's Rock. Apparently this place was made famous by Jennie from BlackPink? Chris said he'd been bringing visitors here for long but it was only after she posted on her social media that this place started blowing up with tourists. Chris being the lad that he is helped people take incredible shots hanging off this particular ledge 
                        <img src="images/lookoutshot.jpg">
    
                         But my oh my a fantastic rock indeed! Good rock! Great rock even.

                        <em>Stop #3 : 1630PM Blue Mountain - Echo's Point</em>  
                        <br><br>
                        Next stop was Echo's point! There was a huge viewing deck here and also a 5km trail that I attempted to speedrun in the 40 minutes time we had here. And as you would imagine it didn't end very well &#129396; Echo point is also where you see the famous 3 sisters rock!

                        <em>Stop #4: 1700PM Ice Cream at Leura Village</em>

                        <br><br>
                         Leura is a charming little town located within Blue Mountains. It was full of pretty flowers and dessert shops. We all snagged some ice cream before heading back up the bus!
                        
                        <img src="images/red pink flowers.jpg">
                        <img src="images/leuraicecream.jpg">
                        Also there was this store selling really cool medieval looking watches and statues!
                        <img src="images/leuracoolstuff.jpg">

                       
                        <br><br>
                        <em>Stop #5: 1730PM Golden Sunset</em>
                        <img src="images/blue mountain susnset stairs.jpg">                        
                        <img src="images/blue mountain sunset heart pose.jpg">


                        Now this HAS to be the the highlight of the trip (and the whole trip was already the highlight to begin with) It was just about the most perfect sunset I've ever seen; The resplendent rays casting a perfect glow over all the land. The sun was a perfect ball sinking slowly beneath the mountain peaks, and I remember just sitting there on the rock watching the sunset and thinking about the enormity of life and the earth. The feeling of insignificance in the grand scheme of things, in view of the vastness and grandeur of the earth, the mountains, and the sky. 
                        <br><br>
                        They call it <em>"The Sublime"</em> â€” an awe and reverence that comes from nature's capacity to overwhelm our senses. An astonishment at the enormity of the earth and an emotional understanding that transcends rational thought and words. 
                        <br><br>
                        It originates in ancient philosophy, developed by theories from Addision, Burke and Kant. So I guess humans have been feeling this way for centuries now. To know that most/everything I've experienced thus far has been experienced before is a humbling yet freeing thought to have. 
                        <br><br>
                        <em>Stop #6: 1830PM Dinner back at Leura Village</em><br><br>
                        So the craziest thing happened at Thai Restaurant we ate at. They gave us a free prawn pad thai because we originally ordered chicken pad thai and they got it wrong so they just let us have both. Then we also ordered green curry but it came a bit late so they told us it was on the house &#128557; Not to mention the food that night was SO BUSSIN. I can't believe how nice the staff were to give us such a discount we ended up paying like $6 per person for that much food?! Insane. But we tipped them generously for sure.

                        
                        <br><br>

                        <em>Stop #7: 2000PM Star Gazing</em><br><br>

                        This is where Chris busted out his Canon camera and tripod and brought us to his favourite spot to capture the milky way. Man really said he knew a spot. I get emotional every time I see a sky full of stars. It just fills me with such joy and sentimentality. Chris also reminded us that everything you see in the sky is but remnants of the past. Even this moment right now, as I write this, as you read this, by the time you've come to think about the moment, it is already the past. How precious every moment we have in this life, how all the more essential it is that we stay present to live in the place where you are now. Not to have your mind constantly worrying/dreaming about the future, or reminiscing/regretting the past. But to live the current moment. it comes, it goes, its gone at last.
                        <img src="images/starsss.jpg">
                        
                        Anyways, Chris took photos for everyone where we had to stand still for really long so the camera could properly capture the stars. On top of that he still goes home to edit the photos on lightroom and photoshop before sending it to us WHAT A LAD and he does this everyday for every single person, he goes home and edits the photos late into the night and starts the day all over again at 12pm. Now that's a hustler if I've seen one. Guys if you ever go sydney please go on Mr Chris's tour I'll send you the link.
