                <h1>Destructive Steps Vol. 16</h1>
                <h4>Australia's Biggest Street Dance Festival</h4>

                        This year celebrates 16 successive years of Destructive Steps, a dance festival created by the community for the community. Dancers from across the country, Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, and from across seas from Japan, China, and New Zealand, flew down to Sydney to share in this banger of a time. The festival saw over 300 audience and contestants over two days.
                        <br><br>
                        After hearing the announcement that this may be the last Destructive Steps for the next few years, and being just a short two hour flight away in Melbourne, I thought I'd be a fool not to capitalise on the opportunity that so kindly presented itself right in front of me.
                        <br><br>
                        Without second thought (and with impulsive little thumbs), I booked my flight to Sydney and packed my bags, figuring out transport and accommodation along the way (bless my two other Melbourne sisters for staying with me). 
                        <br><br>
                        The air was eclectic from the moment I stepped in, sunrays beaming into the glorious exhibition halls of Ultimo Community Centre. Overnight the place had been transformed from a peaceful table tennis court into a dance arena, with booming speakers, graffiti, vintage clothing stores, and a dance mat where people had already started exchanging moves with one another.

                        One word I'd wholeheartedly use to describe the community at the event is so so welcoming. The vibes were immaculate, and it felt like the usual walls to making new acquaintances were gone. Smiles and cheers filled the atmosphere, and almost anything would be a reason to strike up a conversation with a stranger. This extends to Australians in general as well, people here speak with a sense of ease and generosity I only pray I exude back in return. Awfully big huggers as well, I was definitely caught off-guard (but pleasantly surprised!) A bit of a side-track here but I got to make friends with some of Sydney's best poppers, my inspirations for the longest time.

                        <br><br>
                        The first day saw to competitions in the categories of Popping 1v1, Hip Hop 1v1, and Ladies Night 1v1. The prelims took three hours, with over 100 contestants in each category, leaving plenty of time to bond and meet new people there. In comparison, the top 16 to top 4 flew by in a flash (each dancer only given 45s to freestyle per round before the judges give their pick). Before I knew it, it was closing 9pm, and anticipation built as more audience gathered to watch the finals of each category (held in the biggest hall). 
                        <br><br>
                        There is always something so enchanting about watching dance battles live. Something I always find hard to convey when people ask why I so excitedly go for battle after battle. Gettingin and competing is one thing, exhilarating and one of the best feelings in the world. But watching two dancers who have committed much of their lives into their craft battle it out at the highest stakes, watching them hold nothing back, as if their all was on the line, tugs such a strong emotion inside me that I can only describe as a mix of exhilaration, enjoyment, inspiration, and pure epic. A combination that leads me close to tears. 
                        <br><br>
                        While I was planning to write about how the dancers executed their final rounds, I just find that words could not possibly convey the sheer talent they presented, the badassery they showed. Truly dance is an artform of words unspoken, character without explanation, energy shot into the veins. It's confidence and courage. It's showing up loud, and proud. And that is why dance will always have a hold on my heart.
