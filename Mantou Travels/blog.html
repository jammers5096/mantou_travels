                    <p class="standfirst"><strong>The first secret to unlocking flawless hair is understanding your hair type!</strong></p>
                    <p>Your hair’s curl pattern determines your hair type. That will determine whether your hair is straight, wavy, curly, or coily/kinky. 
                        <br><br>
                        <em>Here’s an easy way to check what your hair type is:</em> 
                        <br><br>
                        The next time you wash your hair, let it air dry with no products or heat applied. 
                        <br><br>
                        -  Straight hair will dry straight without bending or curling. <br>
                        -  Wavy hair will dry in an “S” shape. <br>
                        -  Curly hair will dry with a defined curl.<br> 
                        -  Coily/kinky hair will dry in tight curls or spirals.
                        <br><br>
                        Once you know your hair type, try following a dedicated hair care routine that fits your type!
                        <br><br>
                        For <strong>straight</strong> hair, the priority is to control greasiness and maintain your sheen. Since straight hair gets greasy easily, use a sulfate-free shampoo that can remove excess grease and dirt in your hair. 
                        <br><br>
                        Avoid leave-in conditioners if you have straight hair, and only apply conditioner to the ends of your hair rather than the roots. Try to use a light conditioner that won’t weigh down your hair too much. 
                        <br><br>
                        If you have <strong>wavy</strong> hair, you can focus on enhancing and defining your waves. Opt for a sulphate-free, hydrating shampoo and leave-in conditioner without harsh chemicals. 
                        <br><br>
                        Avoid rough towels when drying your hair. Instead, scrunch out the remaining moisture with a soft microfiber towel or soft cotton shirt. After applying styling products like light mousse or gel and a heat protectant, you can use our Flowé hair dryer on low heat to fully dry and style your hair. 
                        <br><br>
                        Tip: Try sleeping on a silk pillowcase to protect your hair while you sleep! 
                        <br><br>
                        Frizz is a common occurrence for <strong>curly</strong> hair, so the key is to retain moisture and combat dryness in your hair. Wash your hair only once a week to keep the natural oils in your curls. Always use a heat protectant before using styling tools like our Flowé hair dryer or any straighteners and curlers. 
                        <br><br>
                        Go for regular hair trims to avoid split ends in your hair! And just like with wavy hair, do not use rough towels when drying your hair. 
                        <br><br>
                        Tip: Use cold water when washing your hair! Hot water can result in more frizz. 
                        <br><br>
                        Finally, if you have <strong>coily</strong> hair, preventing breakage is the most important goal. Protective hairstyles like box braids, bantu knots, and twist-outs can help keep your coils protected. As with curly and wavy hair, you can try using silk pillowcases to protect your hair. 
                        <br><br>
                        You can try a technique called “co-washing” where you use a conditioner and no shampoo to wash your hair to avoid the harsh chemicals from shampoos while keeping your hair clean. 
                        <br><br>
                        Now that you have a better understanding of your hair type and how to care for it, you can leave your house every day with flawless hair and endless confidence!
